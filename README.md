The objective of this project is to demonstrate the arquitecture of a smart contract for crowdfunding that meets
specific requirements. The smart contract will allow project owners to list various projects
and initiate crowdfunding campaigns for each project. Users should be able to participate in
the crowdfunding campaigns by interacting with the smart contract, such as sending funds.

Make sure to assign the right compiler.

Preferably deploy and run this contract in the Sepolia Testnet.
